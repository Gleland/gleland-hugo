<p>From Fall 2015 through Spring 2017 I attended Northern Arizona Univeristy while I pursed my Master's degree. There I took a variety of courses and did research focusing on the lakes of Titan. I investigated different hydrocarbons known to exist in the lakes found on Titan, and performed experiments to see how they would interact with one another. Here is the abstract of my thesis:</p>

<p style="font-size:75%;"><b><i>Understanding how hydrocarbons interact with one another is critical to understanding past, present, and future climates on icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Bodies like Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, contain simple hydrocarbons, yet research is still needed to understand how these species interact physically and chemically. In the Astrophysical Ices Laboratory at Northern Arizona University, I researched how methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) interact with each other at low temperatures and Titan-like pressures, and mapped out the methane-ethane system as a function of composition. We show that this is a eutectic system, meaning the freezing point is depressed down to 71.15&plusmn;0.65 K (whereas pure methane and ethane freeze at 90.56 K and 90.09 K, respectively), at a mix of 64.4&plusmn;1.8% CH<sub>4</sub> - 35.6&plusmn;1.8% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. We also obtained transmission spectra during these experiments and found that the species are attracted to one another and thus the mixture deviates from simple, linear mixing. We provide a catalog of methane and ethane spectra as well as freezing points for others to use in future research.</i></b></p>
