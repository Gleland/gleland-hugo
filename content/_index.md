<p>This is my personal website, it's meant to show some of the more interesting projects that I've worked on and to give me an excuse to learn some more programming along the way. It's constantly changing, so I apologize if something looks a little off. </p>

<p>Currently I'm a Support Engineer III at Amazon. I'm living in Seattle with my partner, Kathryn. We enjoy cookies, hiking, and the occasional run.</p>
